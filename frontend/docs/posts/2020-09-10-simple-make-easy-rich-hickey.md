# simple-make-easy-rich-hickey

::: quote Edsger W. Dijkstra
Simplicity is prerequisite to reliability
:::

* [Rich Hickey] is the creator of [clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure)
* How many things can we keep in mind?
  * Reduce intertwining
* Whats the impact of your change?
* How many place you have to visit to make/implement a change?
* Development speed - long runs | short sprints (agile and XP)

::: quote Leonardo da Vinci
Simplicity is the ultimate sophestication
:::

* [Monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming))

## Clojure

What clojur is?

* Dynamic language
* dialect of LISP
  * Why LISP?
  * dont have to wait for constructs like `forEach` to be implemented by authors
* implemented on top of JVM

Four Ideas

1. Functional language
2. Emphasis on concurrency
   1. broadcast automation systems
3. Designed to be hosted

Real programattic and hygenic macros?
:   That transforms programs into other programs. Unlike C macros, which is crude string substitution system.
