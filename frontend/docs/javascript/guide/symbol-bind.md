# Symbol and Bind

<TagLinks />

## Symbol

guaranteed to be unique.
Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that wonâ€™t collide with keys any other code might add to the object,
and which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to access the object.
That enables a form of weak encapsulation, or a weak form of information hiding.

::: tip Symbols
Symbold are not returned in the result of `Object.keys()`

Used in download managers to manage multiple download sessions without conflict

:::

```js
const obj = {};
const sym = Symbol();
obj[sym] = "foo";
obj.bar = "bar";

console.log(obj); // { bar: 'bar' }
console.log(sym in obj); // true
console.log(obj[sym]); // foo
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ['bar']
```
