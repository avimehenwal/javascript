## :eye_speech_bubble: What the hell is **proto** ?

==javascript uses prototype inheritance== as opposed to classical inheritance used in other
traditional programming languages

`__proto__` is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc.
`prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with new.
